# IOT-datathon-traffic-contraception

This project was done for the Global IOT datathon, where I was able to be ranked within the Top10 projects


Traffic Contraception is a system that loads location based data from various different cities to get meaningful insights on traffic modelling and management. I take data handling from 2 vantage points. Visualization and Statistical modelling.  Visualization is mandatory before performing machine learning operations or statistical modelling, and visualization help us familiarize with the data. After visualizing the data I modeled the data on statistical models. After modelling statistically the data was visualized on graphs for domain experts and city planners to analyze and make prudent changes to the traffic system. Such changes will have potentials to optimize the traffic flow thereby giving a better commute to load-intensive highways.

2. To generate the graphs from the data your self you can run the Python scripts. (dependencies = FB-Prophet)
